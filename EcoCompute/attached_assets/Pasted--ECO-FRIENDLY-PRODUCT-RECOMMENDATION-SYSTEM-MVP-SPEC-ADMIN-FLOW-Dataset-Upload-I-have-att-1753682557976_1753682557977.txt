
✅ ECO-FRIENDLY PRODUCT RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM — MVP SPEC
🔧 ADMIN FLOW
Dataset Upload: I have attached the dataset here.


Trigger Hybrid Scoring (only if eco_score column is empty):


Score 29,000 products using Mistral-7B.


Select top 5,000.


Re-score them using LLaMA-2.


Final dataset is saved in PostgreSQL.



👤 USER FLOW
1. User Onboarding
Sign Up: name, email, password, age, gender → stored in DB.


Login: email, password → authenticated via Flask sessions.


2. Homepage Recommendations
Cold Start: Based on age & gender (for new users).


Personalized: Based on age, gender + session activity:


Viewed log


Wishlist


Cart


3. Activity Tracking
Every click:


Adds to viewed_products (session + DB).


Wishlist/Cart:


Updates both session (temporary) and PostgreSQL (permanent).

Please prioritize building out the search functionality for the MVP. This should allow users to search products using either the product title or keywords found in the user review text (text column). The search should be case-insensitive, support partial keyword matching, and ideally leverage either ILIKE or full-text search capabilities from PostgreSQL for efficiency.
In addition to the search, we need a basic User Section. This includes Sign Up and Login using Flask sessions, and once the user is logged in, they should see a profile section (preferably on the top bar or sidebar) showing their name, email, age, and gender. Quick links to Cart, Wishlist, and Logout should also be part of this section.
For new users (i.e., those who have no prior activity), the homepage should recommend products based on the user’s age and gender. These fields will be collected during signup and matched against the age and gender columns already available in the dataset I've provided.
The goal is to ensure that even first-time users immediately see relevant, personalized recommendations based on the demographic data collected during onboarding.
